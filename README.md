What is Uscoin?
----------------

What is Universal Settlement Coin? USC has been designed to remove some significant hurdles which prevent 
large business and corporate users from joining the crypto currency revolution while continuing to offer 
an uncompromised crypto currency solution for day-to-day activities. We are specifically focused on 
replacing the existing service used to make international payments around the world; SWIFT.
USC is not just for corporates, in fact everyday users will be able to send and receive USC coins 
almost immediately for very small transaction fees and as we expand our partnerships then we expect 
USC to be used as a global medium of exchange. We refer to the standard day-to-day functional as the 
‘Retail Lane’.

The second lane, called the Corporate Lane, is designed for corporate customers who want to use the 
global value exchange potential of crypto currencies but are unable to do so today due to concerns 
with the fungibility and sourcing of the underlying crypto currency, such as Bitcoin, face. The major 
difference is that Lane 2 will solely use coins which have been freshly minted (mined) or coins which 
have only been used in Lane 2 transactions. Miners who support the Corporate Lane will be rewarded with 
higher fees as corporates will be charged by an exchange to use the service. Miners will be able to 
select which corporate exchange they wish to use based on who offers the best fees and services.
There’s no difference between the payment priority on the Retail and Corporate lanes (we operate on 
the net neutrality principle).
